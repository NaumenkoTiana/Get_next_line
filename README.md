## What's a project

To write a function
that will allow you to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor.
We can use our library - [libft] (https://github.com/NaumenkoTiana/libft)

No leaks, the BUFF SIZE can be 1 or 100, it works correctly. The program allows to read several files.

## How to use

If you don't have clang, you need to install it
``` C
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt install clang
```
then write
``` C
bash test.sh && clear && ./test_gnl
```

test.sh is exetubale.

There are 3 main tests in `main.c`, you can test it.
